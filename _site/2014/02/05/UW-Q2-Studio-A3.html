Summary: I try my hands on video prototyping and create a commercial-like video instead... </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For the third assignment we were free to choose any one of our previous project or just about anything in the market and create a video prototype of the product or service. The concept, the storyline, the impact, the message was all for the student to decide. I used one of my project which I did in previous quarter. It was about an mobile App which helps you take medical decisions around Doctors, Treatments and facilities. </p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>I discovered that I just can&#39;t do straight story lines. Something that starts simply with a problem, then shows the perfect solution was beyond my implementation. I just had to create some twisty plot, which had ups and downs. It gets more difficult because of time constrains on the video. No wonder I messed up a bit, but it was my first time and I learned a lot. After getting a vague idea in mind, I started storyboarding. I wrote down scenes, their motive and the voice over, if any. The video can be  divided into three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first part tried to create lonely and melancholy feelings in the viewer. I used slow shots. Used some effects to so that time appears not to move. </li>
<li>Bridge: Its role was to connect the first part and the second, otherwise it won&#39;t make much sense.</li>
<li>The last part, this section finally explains the features offered by the App and how can it provide value to a medical care needer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the video:</p>

<div class="flex-video widescreen" style="margin: 0 auto;text-align:center;">

</div>
 

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>After critiques I could clearly see many problems with the video.
* The video wasn&#39;t focusing entirely on the product usage. The screenshots were small
* The bridge failed for most of the audience and the purpose of first part became debatable.
* The voice over (which is always pretty tough to get good quality) could be definitely done better.</p>

<p>Though the video was appreciated for scenematic shots, it didn&#39;t meet the desired purpose entirely.</p>
