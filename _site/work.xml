			The project tried to bring attention to usually ignored bodily signals which can be crucial for good health and 'well being' in long run. We do this by capturing data, generated by our body, which can be pivotal in decision making. We currently focus on tracking personal Air quality data.
		
			During the initial ideation phase I constantly contributed a technical perspective to the project. I brought new ideas and current market standings to the table. And primarily, I tried to narrow down the huge topic of tracking body data by following convergent techniques so as to have a conceivable and actionable direction for the project. Later, I drafted the implementation plan for the project.

			The cost of health care in America has become an issue that affects the quality of life
of virtually everybody in the nation. In short, America spends about 18 cents of every dollar the economy produces on health care. This is almost twice the level of many of our fellow first world nations. More concern is that even after spending so much, the life expectancy in America is ranked at 33rd position.

In a survey our team conducted, about 65% of our respondents said cost plays a deciding factor in their health care treatment, despite virtually all of our respondents having health care insurance of some form. Clearly, the cost of health care in America is unsustainable and something has to be done about it. Also we found out that people rely a lot on reviews about healthcare facilities and Doctors, especially from friends and family.

RevealCare is a smart phone app that lets users to compare health care treatment costs within a map framework. It also allows users to search both facility and doctor reviews and to submit their own. RevealCare aims to help users make more educated purchasing decision around their health care treatments.

			Skulpturous is a 3D authoring tool which helps students, artists and possibly designers to model and visualize 3D objects. It uses your full body gestures and voice to create wonderful illustrations. It is a vision to bring 3D content creation to masses, a world where 3D creation and printing is done at every home.

			I took Skulpturous to its next milestone by concentrating on three things broadly: Dynamic Customized Gestures, more Interaction techniques and better Accuracy. I accomplished these goals by: 1) Using Machine Learning for recognition of user created dynamic gestures, so now the user could create personal gestures to perform certain tasks 2) Taking inspiration from real life sculpting to create novel interaction techniques to model 3D objects 3) Increasing the precision of hand location by data fusion, here we fuse data from Kinect and multiple smart phone sensors to have a more precise estimate of hand location.

			Inspired from human perception of depth we generate real-time relative depth map from a single moving monocular camera using Lucas-Kanade optical flow method.
