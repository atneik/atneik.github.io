##SummaryTweak the Tweets generates Tweets in a formal manner, so as to utilize social media as a two-way communication channel during emergencies, crises and disasters. The tweets generated using the App helps better parsing of the information. The idea was devised by Kate Starbird at University of Colorado (more about it can be found [here](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~starbird/tweak-the-tweet.html)). And here is the link to the Android App I developed. [Tweak the Tweets](https://github.com/atneik/TtT) ##ProblemDuring emergencies social media gets flooded with important information, which could be determinant of ones life, but due to no formal format to the structure of the information and also because of noise, it becomes difficult to process this information into actions. Tweak the Tweets presents a formal format which could be used to generate tweets during disasters and crisis for a two way communication for help and also for providing help. ####Process & Improvements * _Analysis of Spec:_ We were given the design specification of the App to be developed. I used the specification more as a guidance rather then following it pixel by pixel. It pointed out the flow of creating a structured tweet, and other features, but was limited by not following some of the Android Design Principles. It also had other features which were either not needed or could be improved, such as a splash screen (which is not a good idea for a App to be used in emergency situations), a complicated long process to create a tweet (it involved redundant entering of information), etc.  
* _Paper Prototyping:_ To get the interaction right, I used mobile screen cards to quickly create a set of paper prototype which adhered to the protocol, but used less screens to do so. I placed the elements (tweet being constructed and information needed) on each screen consistently, easier to find. I gave special consideration to Defaults, as in case of emergency one may just tap repeatedly in order to send tweet as soon as possible.  * _Development I:_ With rough paper prototypes in hand I began coding the first iteration of the App. I used Twitter API to log in user, and Google Map API to find street address of current location. I enjoyed being back to Android development after almost 2 years. I did not work on visual aspect of the App, but rather just focused on the interactivity and robustness of the application.* _Self Testing:_ Now, I tried to experience using the App by creating some tweets. I found the overall procedure still slow (after removing some activities suggested in the spec). At this moment I was reminded of Intents in Android platforms. An Intent can call other application/activity to get work done without doing the same thing itself. Using them I could use the already signed in official Twitter App to send tweets and remove the hassle of login altogether. Hence, enabling the creation of first tweet faster.* _Development II:_  With some points form the evaluation, I implemented and also pruned some features in the mobile App.  * _Final Evaluation:_ Finally, I got few volunteers to test my App. They generated few tweets as fast as possible. The end result was satisfactory. ##PrototypeIn this section I present screen shots of various pages in the hi-fi prototype, but start with content structure and initial layout design.####Screenshots* First screen

<br />##Analysis####Conclusion & Critiques 
During this exercise I understood how prior domain (technical) knowledge about a system can make the end interaction better. And how design and technology should work together, rather separately. As, without prior knowledge in the domain I couldn't have made the interactivity simpler.High level prototyping can give answers to important questions, as one can truly experience how the end interaction will be like. The speed, the content is original and gives more valuable feedback from the users. But, it should be done quickly enough so as to iterate over multiple designs in constrained time.
