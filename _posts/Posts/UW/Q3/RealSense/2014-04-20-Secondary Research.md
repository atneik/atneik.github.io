## 3D gesture interaction: technologies, platforms, applications, research


#### What is the conventional wisdom or “state of the art” of this domain?

1. Research
	* Finger modelling
	* Sensing the depth (distance from the surface) of ﬁngers/hands near a tabletop – Z-touch [Link](http://www.dfki.de/its2010/papers/pdf/sp107.pdf)
	* 3D sensor for unencumbered free-form, single-handed gestural interaction with head-mounted displays (HMDs) [Link](http://www.rle.mit.edu/stir/documents/ColacoKYGSG_UIST2013.pdf)
	* Active (on body) or Passive (in environment) sensors.
	* Tangible Pairing: TouchPair : Dynamic Analog-Digital Object Pairing for Tangible Interaction using 3D Point Cloud Data 
2. Industry
	* Kinect
	* Windows Phone - 3D Touch
	* Intel’s Perceptual Computing
	* Samsung’s Air Gestures
	* Leap

#### Who are notable experts on this topic? Practioners or researchers/academics?

-

#### How does value flow in this domain? (financial or other)
* New experience
* Immersive
* Full body
* Makes certain activities easier.
* Experience Economy

#### What are the social or cultural patterns influences, trends in this domain?
* Hard to adopt by masses unless provides value
* Currently only enthusiast and early adopters
* But, gaming industry is well aware

#### Are there clear problems or challenges in this space that have yet to be addressed?

* Value by 3D interaction should be greater than existing techniques

* Interactions can be socially awkward

* Fingers/Hands can get tired while performing gestures in the air

* Feedback – haptic: co-located feedback.

* What are important quantitative facts for this topic?

#### What is the potential role of HCI?

* Come up with unambiguous set of interactions to provide all together new 

* May target only a small niche of users, or only a case

* Find use cases / solutions in other domains experience for the user.
