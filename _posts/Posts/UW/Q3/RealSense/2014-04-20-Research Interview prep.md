#### Questions for Semi Structured Interview?

* What do you think is the next paradigm of User Interface?
	* Why that? Why not this?
* What do you think is the future of 3D gesture interaction systems? 
	* Do you see it mass deployed? 
		* If yes, by what time frame?
		* If not, why not?
* What todays cutting edge research can bring to current gesture based platforms for providing a better UX? 
	* What do you think is missing?
* Where/ In which domains do you see this technology as useful?

#### Potential Primary Research Questions or Topics
* Where does value come from in industries utilizing 3D gesture technology?
* How has feedback been integrated into 3D gesture technology?
* What AI tech exists to interpret human body language and emotion?
* How could new input hardware better enable this?
* What role will gesture technology play in the experience economy?
* How could 3D gesture technology enable adaptive user interfaces?
* How do ubiquitous computing systems in a built environment utilize gesture technology?
