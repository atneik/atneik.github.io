## Process

After paper prototyping last week, it was time for 3D. We were suppose to design and build a prototype of an EcoATM within 2 hours. For those who wonder what that is - its simply a mobile phone recycling box which give you some cash (not much) for your old phone. There were some basic functional requirements that need to be covered:

* A touch screen
* A receipt and QR code printer
* Cash Dispenser
* A _safe_ compartment wherein user can deposit the phone
* An ID Scanner
* Visual Scanner for detecting device condition, etc.

Some non-functional requirements that we considered:

* Accessibility
* Gives sense of Security and Transparency 
* Ergonomics

Before heading to the development board, we scratched our head for improving the current state of art. We identified some of the problems which we could address, such as:

* The screen placement wasn't for everyone. 
* The phone placing compartment was opaque. It gave a feeling of insecurity.
* The overall flow and processes was way too complex.

After discussing these issues we individually sketched some ideas. We spend a considerable time sketching, as compared to others, though in this particular exercise we suppose to think with hands. But, it was fruitful, we came with an ambitious and unique idea for implementing the system.

And finally this is what we build..

The screen was the center of the design. We conceptualized it to have a camera to recognize faces and adjust according to there height. For this we made it in such a way it had two degrees of freedom, it rotated on the horizontal axis and went up and down. The user could place the phone on the screen when it was completely horizontal. The compartment was replaced by covering up the screen with a transparent cover after the phone was placed. The system can be better understood in action than by reading words (one of the reason to prototype).

We actually used Wizard of Oz technique to give the experience of using it. Here is a fun video..

## What I learned?

* Modeling promotes thinking on-the-fly. You're ideating about possible solutions while you're building stuff.
* Brings out possible issues with the design.
* Makes you feel & experience the product without much investment (two hours?).
* It's a great tool to better communicate ones idea.
* It's fun!
