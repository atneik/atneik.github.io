## Summary

This report presents the design and user testing while Model Prototyping a Handheld immersion blender. It was a weeklong project with focus on thinking with hands and in 3D. The product, i.e. the hand blender, needs to be developed for OXO brand, who are known for practicing universal design principles. The design of the prototype tries to adhere to the identity of the brand. The first section explains about constrains and the problem. The next section deals with designing of three separate prototypes of the product. The forth section showcases the prototypes. Finally, the report ends with an analysis and learning outcomes of the project.  

 
## Problem

“Life is too short for bad design”. A badly designed tool can result in injury, be unusable, be unfit for a range of audience, etc. OXO have been designing tools for cooking and food preparation by keeping the user in centre and coming up with products that can be universally used and appreciated. Now, they wish to diversify by incorporating new technology with their well-known easy to use tools in a handheld immersion hand blender. Next section describes constrains of the design problem as derived from OXO’s principles and for well functioning of the product. The project focuses on characteristics such as ergonomics, easy to hold, fits everyone.

 
## Design

#### Design Considerations & Constrains

* Ergonomic & Universal design: As OXO follows universal design for developing products, which can fit quite large number of population. The product should be applicable to large audience; esp. considering extreme users such as with disabilities or a chef who uses it for long period of time and it should even be easy enough for casual users. Also, the product should be quite comfortable to be used for extended period of time. It should also not cause any injury while using it. This is the reason the prototypes are designed in accordance to fit most human hands and give support to specific portions of hand to minimise stress.
* Good Grips: The Good Grip series of the OXO brand boasts about large rubberised grips with serrated sides which provides confortable grip and confidence to a large number of people. Therefore, the three prototypes have large handles, which covers most portions of a hand and provides a secure grip. 
* Left/Right handed: Both left-handed and right-handed users should be able to comfortably use the product.
* Usage: Here usage means that the user should be able to grab the blender by multiple positions. Moreover it should be intuitive enough to hold it correctly. While testing, it came to notice that some users prefer pressing the button using thumb and rest using index or middle finger. The prototypes consider that it should be comfortable to hold from multiple positions.
* Safe: One of the prime things to keep in mind is safety of the device. Varied people in varied context would use the device. One such feature that all prototypes present is that of a ‘push button’ instead of two ‘on’ and ‘off’ buttons. The blender only runs when the button is pressed. This way if the device is goes out of control it would stop, and not continue running.
* Screen and Buttons placement: The screen should be visible when using the device and also the main button should be easily accessible to a large audience. The screen displays information about current speed of motor, current consistency or viscosity of the food being blended.
* Reach & Immersion: Hand blenders are flexible and have more use cases than a normal standing blender. They create less mess as one can blend or chop in the same vessel. They can also be used when the pot is on the stove, due to mobility. They can even reach a glass bottom. For these reasons, it was kept in mind that the design should be portable and the arm of the blender should be thin in diameter in order to reach bottom of most vessels.
* Change speed while running using single hand: One problem that I regularly face when I use a hand blender is that, one cannot change the speed of the motor while it is running without using a second hand. The prototypes presented place the speed selector button in such a manner that it is accessible even when a person is running the machine.
* Set consistency: The user should not only be able to see a consistency, but also set a desired value of consistency. Herein the user will be informed by a ‘beep’ when the set consistency is reached. 
* Simple: The OXO’s designs are simple and intuitive to masses. It is considered that user is not bombarded with buttons. Minimal interface with priority to the most common case of ‘just blending’ for an average user is given importance while designing the prototypes.
* Weight: To mimic the weight of a hand blender clay is used. Centre of mass and more weight of the motor is considered by inserting iron mesh in the core of the prototypes. 
* Dimensions: To fit in the motor all three prototypes have 2.5 inches diameter at the widest width. Two of the three prototypes are more than 12 inches in height.   
 
#### Basic Functionality

* Main push button for running the motor.
    * All three prototypes posses an easy accessible push button to turning on the motor and start blending. The button can pressed either using fingers or using a thumb.
* Speed control.
    * All three prototypes have a variable speed control unit. It has been positioned in such a way that one can change the speed while running it using the same hand. This enables users to operate the device single-handedly. 
* Display.
    * The display shows the user primly two quantities. One is the current speed of the motor. Other is the current viscosity of the liquid being blended. The user can also set the viscosity and the device will alert the user using a ‘beep’ when that value of viscosity is reached. 
* Viscosity.
    * User should be able to set viscosity. The device will alert the user when specified viscosity or consistency has been reached.

 
## Prototype

Before prototyping the model of a hand blender, I basically did three activities. 

* Firstly, read more about OXO. I researched about their design philosophy, inspected their current product line, watched video demo of the products. This gave me design principles, which were common and followed at OXO. Some of them are listed in above section. 
* Then secondly, I researched the product. For this, I visited an electronic appliance store to see current market offerings. I watched some cookery videos online to see how a cook typically uses a hand blender. Having been using hand blenders for long, I was amazed to discover that people don’t use it like I do. I use my thumb to press the main button, but some people use their fingers to push to main button. This changes the ergonomics of the design. After this, I laid down some constrains and design principles that are mentioned in above section.

* Finally, I went to the drawing board to sketch some of the initial designs. After being satisfied with the first sketch I went to model the conception using clay.

#### Prototype 1

The first prototype I developed unfortunately broke and I just have a single picture of it. It had a large grip and fitted my hand perfectly. But upon quick testing with more hands it was obvious that the grip needed to be slimmer in future prototypes. In this one I used a filled plastic as core. But then in future designs I used a wire mesh. Wire mesh allowed less bulky grip and gave me more freedom to sculpt it.   

#### Prototype 2

The second prototype was slimmer than the first one at grip, but big enough to be following OXO’s Good Grip product line. Its usage was focused upon pressing the main button by thumb. The thumb intuitively fitted around the portion for push button. It was comfortable using by either left or right hand. There was embossment at the top of the design, this was to distribute the weight to the fingers. Also, it had support for the palm. One can set the viscosity using the scroll so that the device alerts user when certain consistency is reached.

#### Prototype 3

The problem with the earlier prototype was that it was focused upon users who uses thumb to press the main button. In this next version The button was placed is such a manner that it could easily be controlled using fingers or using a thumb. The other dynamics of the prototype, such as the support and contours matched either side of griping case.

#### Prototype 4

The forth and the last prototype tried to combine the push button for running the motor and the speed control into one. The ball supports one axis movement for setting the speed. The same ball could be pushed to run the motor. For turbo mode it has a button in the front. The display is located at the top. Both left and right-handed users can use it comfortably.

## Analysis

#### Improvements

The prototypes were evolved as the problems were discovered, but still keeping in mind the diversity of design. For example, the first prototype was too large for most hands therefore the size of the handle was reduced. The second design concentrated on users who press the main button by thumb. Then upon discovering that there are users who prefer to use fingers instead of thumb, the design was evolved. While designing all the prototypes constrains and principles listed in above sections where kept in mind and also discovered. 

#### Conclusion & Critiques 

The testers appreciated the efforts to incorporate good ergonomics and universal design. But, they also criticised the lack of any colour or interface on the device. This was intentional, as I wanted to check the intuitiveness of the button by just feeling it. I didn’t wanted to give visual clues to the button and wanted to test that if the prototypes performed fine if the user is just touching/feeling the prototype. The focus of testing was on comfort, both handed and accessibility of buttons.

In case of 60-sec video, the audio was a problem. The volume was low, and not all could correctly understand what user tester was saying. Though, the video was commended for being simple and to the point.
