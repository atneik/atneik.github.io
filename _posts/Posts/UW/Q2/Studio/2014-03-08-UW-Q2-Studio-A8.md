## Summary

Whats better than imagining something and then just printing it! 3D modeling tools are getting more easier to use and now with 3D printing more accessible than ever before, Prototyping is taken to a whole new level. Here I show showcase some of my early experiments with Rhinoceros, OpenSCAD and the MakerBot.

## Experiments

### A sound system

My first model using [Rhinoceros](http://www.rhino3d.com/) was a sound system. It uses simple transformations and tools like Revolve, Boolean difference, etc.

### A fractal pen stand
3D Modeling reminded me of Kinect, and took me back to it, which I have ignored for a while now. I captured my face using the Kinect depth sensor and imported it to Rhino with an idea to make coins using it (I'll do that later sometime).

Instead, to satisfy my coding side, I then hopped on to [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) after seeing it used extensively for making Things being shared at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/). And its impressive! Give it a try. I tried making some parametric designs using it by recursively calling simple cubes. The end result was a Fractal with diminishing cuboids.

To make some-'Thing' out of it, I exported it to Rhino and boolean differenced two cylinders on one side and my face on the other side. The cylinders could be used for holding pen/pencile. You can [download it from Thingiverse.](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267176)

##Prototype
Now I felt I was ready to make something useful, which could actually be printed and used. Few days ago we felt the need of a bottle opener at the studio, this inspired me to put newly learned skills at work. I took an existing bottle opener, analyzed it, measured it (esp. the bottle opening part) and started modeling using Rhino. After some operations, I ended up with this.

As it was suppose to be printed using plastic and not metal, I increased its height by 2mm. To compensate for the increase in height I had to tapper the part using which a bottle is opened for its smoother function. The top left part is for opening cans. It also have a hole for attaching it with let say a ring. Finally I customized it by embossing 'MHCI+D' and 'Fractal Opener' on it. I scaled and added the fractal design to give it some character. At the back it has embedded 'HCI+D' (It uses the same embossed letters of MHCI+D, this works as it remains the same if mirrored w.r.t to the horizontal axis). You can [download it from Thingiverse.](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267179)

## Analysis

Physical prototyping is great to answer questions like: How it feels like? Is the size right? Is it ergonomic? One can go beyond and use special materials to mimic actual touch and weight. Its quick (depending upon the fidelity) and precise!
