##Summary

Weekly Rapid Prototyping: In reverse order, from high fidelity to low fidelity. Click on the title to see the full blog post about the prototype.


## Prototypes

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/03/08/UW-Q2-Studio-A8.html" target="_blank"> Physical Prototype: Experiments & A Bottle Opener </a>

Whats better than imagining something and then just printing it! 3D modeling tools are getting more easier to use and now with 3D printing more accessible than ever before, Prototyping is taken to a whole new level. Here I show showcase some of my early experiments with Rhinoceros, OpenSCAD and the MakerBot.

Go ahead [download](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267179) this fancy bottle opener from Thingiverse and print it!

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/02/22/UW-Q2-Studio-A6.html" target="_blank"> Mobile Prototype: Tweak the Tweets </a>

Tweak the Tweets generates Tweets in a formal manner, so as to utilize social media as a two-way communication channel during emergencies, crises and disasters. The tweets generated using the App helps better parsing of the information. The idea was devised by Kate Starbird at University of Colorado (more about it can be found [here](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~starbird/tweak-the-tweet.html)).

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/02/09/UW-Q2-Studio-A4.html" target="_blank"> Behavioral Prototype: Gesture recognition platform </a>

We build and test a behavioral prototype for a gestural user interface for a TV system. They system had to allow for basic video function controls (play, pause, stop, fast forward, rewind, etc.) Our team chose to pursue a 3D gesture system. The goal of our prototype and evaluation was to explore the following design research and usability questions:

* How can a user effectively control video playback using hand gestures?
* What are the most intuitive gestures for this application?
* What level of accuracy is required in this gesture recognition technology?

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/02/05/UW-Q2-Studio-A3.html" target="_blank"> Video Prototyping: Medical App </a>

I try my hands on video prototyping and create a commercial-like video instead...

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/01/25/UW-Q2-Studio-A2.html" target="_blank" > Model Prototyping: Hand Blender </a>

In this weeklong project with focus on thinking with hands and in 3D, I learned Model Prototyping a Handheld immersion blender. The product, i.e. the hand blender, needs to be developed for OXO brand, who are known for practicing universal design principles. The design of the prototype tries to adhere to the identity of the brand.

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/01/19/UW-Q2-Studio-A1.html" target="_blank" > Paper Prototyping: Wearable UIs </a>

“Wearables are the future!”, as deemed by majority of futurist. Together with a smartphone they can provide altogether new experiences. Here we choose a Smartwatch as the wearable and try to understand the interplay between the two devices. The accessibility of a Smartwatch and low friction involved in using it can be exploited to provide omnipresent computing. This week long endeavour used the technique of paper prototyping to quickly iterate over various designs possible for a Fitness App. The App helps user create routines in a smartphone and then help them follow the same while working out though the smartwatch as a medium. The system is named Gym Mate.

### <a href="/studio/playground/2014/01/13/UW-Q2-Studio-E1.html" target="_blank" > Paper Prototyping a Coffee Shop App </a>
	
Paper prototyping an Tablet App for ordering coffee at a Cafe. The project was narrowed to include only three kinds of coffee (Espresso, Macchiato and Cappuccino) coming in three different sizes. So, a total of nine offerings.
