The project tried to bring attention to usually ignored bodily signals which can be crucial for good health and 'well being' in long run. We do this by capturing data, generated by our body, which can be pivotal in decision making. We currently focus on tracking personal Air quality data.
		
During the initial ideation phase I constantly contributed a technical perspective to the project. I brought new ideas and current market standings to the table. And primarily, I tried to narrow down the huge topic of tracking body data by following convergent techniques so as to have a conceivable and actionable direction for the project. Later, I drafted the implementation plan for the project.
