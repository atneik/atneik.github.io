##SummaryWebsite Prototype of our very own dub website (http://dub.washington.edu). It was a weeklong project with focus on developing wireframe mockup that could give the experience of the redesign. The first section explains about the design constrains, the process and the problem. The next section deals with designing of the prototype. Finally, the report ends with an analysis and learning outcomes of the project.  Live link [here](http://atneik.github.io/dub-final/home.html) ##Problem“Design. Use. Build” - That’s what the dub stands for (and of course also W in UW), and this isn’t even mentioned on its website. When I first visited the website, a year ago, I had a tough time figuring out what exactly dub is. The site looks dated, not only due to lack of dynamic content but also because of the design emphasis in certain elements. There are various problems with the site, which are discussed in detail in following sections. ####Design Process* _Research & Analysis:_ We were given the research outcomes of a small study previously done on the site. It highlighted the main audience of the website. This helped me create personas and possible use cases of the website. I also researched a bit on my own, by reading user comments on the blog posts. The need for a RSS feed was apparent plus some other features. I also analysed the content placement and equated them with use cases. This gave me rough priority of the content.* _Content:_ Next step was to actually lay down the importance of content, and what all need to be on the site, based upon the research and analysis. Events, Publications, News and information about faculty came out to be the top ones.* _Information Architecture:_  Now. I organized the sections into a hierarchical fashion with most important ones being on the top. Also the name of the top sections should aid in discovering the sub-sections within it. So, it was important that top sections have clear names and structure, so that it is intuitive for a first time visitor to find content. It is here I created a rough site map of the upcoming prototype.* _Lo-fi Wireframe:_ After laying down the priority of various sections, sketched few skeleton wireframe. I made sure the sub-sections have consistency, as in the visitor can somewhat expect the information underneath subsections based upon visiting a section. I iterated many designs to come up with the position and size of the content for various pages. * _Hi-fi Wireframe:_ Finally, I used Axure to develop a relatively high fidelity prototype of the website. To my surprise, I discovered more flaws with the design with a hi-fi prototype. The reason being it actually gives the pixel perfect experience of the mockup, and I could figure out the problems as interacted with the site.####Design Considerations & Improvements* _More emphasis on Events:_ I placed ‘upcoming events’ feed on the front page, with important information like date, time, location, speaker, etc., so that a visitor can glace on the landing page and decide if he/she want to go to the event. Also, it gave more of a frequently updated and dynamic look to the website. This was important, as the current one looks very dated.* _A large picture changing banner:_ A changing graphic banner on the front page made the website more interesting and engaging. This was to help in directly landing the visitor to a spotlight Event happening in the dub community. A past event, or a News item both can land as a banner on the front page.* _Restructure of the News feed:_ I didn’t use any images in the News feed on the front page. This was to incorporate more new items and also to give it a more ticker like feeling. This used less space and provided recent news when the visitor lands on the website.* _Adding an About section:_ It is odd that current website doesn’t have a dedicated page to share the vision, history, facts and to get an overview of the community. This is specially need for first time visitors.* _Placement of Blog in People section:_ To me it made more sense to place the blog posts in People section.* _Research section:_ The Research section was a major overhaul as it combined Projects/Research Areas, Publications, Get Involved, and Downloads in one section. Careful thought was put in to determine the inter relation of these sub-sections.* _People:_  The sections shows pictures of the faculty to aid students (major audience) find the person they are looking for. Also, they can sort the section according to department. The research interests are placed on the Peoples page itself, so as to support discovery according to interest fields.* _Footer with logo of the four departments:_ To show the collective effort of all the departments involved in this vibrant community.•	Sorting of News and Events: This feature helped in ordering News and Events items according to time to make it easy to discover/find items.* _Better Login/Logout and Account section:_ A login button for members. A better Account sections where members can edit their profile and publications. The session is maintained throughout the site.####Basic Functionality* Learn about the community (About) * Find out what’s happening in the community	* Events		* Upcoming 		* Past		* Direct to the Vimeo video of past events.	* News		* RSS feed and Sharing options * Find people/members and learn about them	* Their Research interests, Bio, publications, Projects* Find Research Areas / on going Projects	* Publications	* People involved in that Research* Add/Edit profile and publications (Login/Account/Logout)* Download projects  ##PrototypeIn this section I present screen shots of various pages in the hi-fi prototype, but start with content structure and initial layout design.####Information Architecture ![sketch](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W5/1.jpg)####Sketch of the layout

One of them was the placement of the menu bar. It was taking too much space in the already crowded home page. The news section had to go off with images on the front page so as to give it a more news ticker feeling and better space utilization. Also, on every page I added links to related pages under same section, this aided in navigation.####Conclusion & Critiques I tested on few students who frequently visit the current page. The prototype did quite well in by emphasising on most common use cases, i.e. looking up the upcoming events, news updates and exploring the faculty.It wasn’t the best in terms of aesthetics and space utilization. I guess I had to compromise that on front page in order to show Events, News and the banner. A few content elements were off the layout grid, which I realized later.
